	Specific Shape, c040!0060

This is the twisted pentomino.
It is 3 across in one dimension, 2 across in the others.
Within the box, a piece can be oriented left to right,
front to back, or standing up, as per its long dimension.

Without loss of generality, put A in the back lower left corner,
left two right, with 3 cubes against the back wall.
As we travel along the edge formed by the floor and the back wall,
left to right pieces can't continue forever.
Let B be the last such, i.e., the rightmost.
Reflect if need be, so B has the orientation that A had before,
i.e. 3 cubes against the back wall.

Put C against the back wall next to B.
C is not left to right.
Let C stand up.
There is only one way it can do that, and that leaves a notch beneath.
Put D in this notch, remembering it cannot be left to right.
D is front to back, leaving a gap of height 2 behind D.
Let E fill this gap.
It must stand up, exactly like C.
Put F to the right of E against the wall.
F is a copy of D.
This continues down the wall forever.
Therefore, C does not stand up.

C is front to back, and it can only lie down in one way.
Put D in the space behind C.
D stands up, with a notch beneath.
Let E fill this notch. E is front to back.
Put f in the gap behind E; F is a copy of D.
This continues down the wall forever.

That was the last option for C.
Therefore, this piece has order 0.

The same proof works for extended (stretched out) versions of this piece.
