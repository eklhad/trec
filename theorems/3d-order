What is the order of some small 3d polyominoes?

	Volume

If you want to use all three dimensions, the volume has to have
at least 3 prime factors.
If it has exactly 3, p×q×r, then your box is p by q by r.
If there are 4 prime factors, 2 of them join together to make 1 dimension,
and the other prime factors establish the other dimensions.

	Tetrominoes

The line, L, triangle, square, have orders 1, 2, 4, 1,
in the plane or in a flat box, i.e. a box of thickness 1.
The stair tetrominoe has order 6, in a 3 by 2 by 4 box.
The twisted tetromino, our first 3 dimensional piece, has order 2,
and the corner piece has order 2.

	Pentominoes

Start with the 12 flat penominoes.
They are, in my nomenclature: the line, the L, the Y
(you have to tilt it a little to look like a Y), the C, the stairs, the faucet,
the Utah, the lightning bolt, the zigzag, the T, the cross, and the chair.
The line, the L, the Utah, and the Y, have orders 1, 2, 2, and 10.
Can Y do better in a box?
Its order can't be prime, for then the box would be flat.
Order 4 or 6 builds a box that is too skinny.
Even 9 implies 3 by 3, too skinny.
Pieces all stand up against each other and that doesn't work.
8 implies 2 by 4 by 5. Verify this doesn't work, so 10 it is.

C has order 6.

Cross has order 0; it still can't fit into a corner.

When a piece lives in a 3 by 3 square, like the T or faucet or chair,
it can't fill a box of thickness 2.
It would have to tile one layer, then the next layer, so would tile a rectangle,
and we can quickly determine these pentominoes don't tile a rectangle.
Orders 4, 6, 8, and 10 won't work.
At this point I had to resort to software, i.e. 3dbox.c.
The stair pentomino has order 36,
the chair has order 18,
the lightning has order 8,
the faucet has order 36,
the T has order 60,
and the zigzag has order <= 135.
See solution-3d for the matrix representation of these packings.
That takes care of the flat penominoes.

As we move to the 3 dimensional pentominoes, chirality comes into play.
For consistency, I allow a piece to be reflected, just as I do in the plane.
If you build a physical model of the puzzle, you have to make left and right
handed versions of the piece, perhaps the correct number of each reflection,
which gives a hint on solving the puzzle.
For example, start with the L tetromino, and place a cube on top
of the end of the long leg, opposite to the short leg.
This is e080!20 in our notation.
It has order 18, using this piece in all its rotations and reflections.
We can place a cube on top of the L tetromino in 3 more ways, giving:
e080!40 order 4, e080!80 order 18, and e080!0080 order 6.
Put a cube atop the triangle tetromino, and e040!0040 has order 10, and e040!40 has order <= 240.
Put a cube atop the stair tetromino, and c060!80 has order 4, and c060!40 has order 28.
Putting a cube atop a 2 by 2 square gives c0c0!80 with order 4.
There are only two penominoes left, the two that do not have 4 cubes in a plane.
These are c080!00c0, with order <= 108,
and c040!0060, which, I believe, has order 0.
My software can't tile the first layer of the box, of any size.
In other words, it can't get off the floor.
Perhaps you can help me develop a formal proof of untilability.

We obviously aren't going to evaluate all the hexominoes, however, the one that
started it all for me in 1987, the Y hexomino, f840, has order 92 in the plane,
and it has order 28 in 3 dimensions, filling a box that is 2 by 7 by 12.

Recall the (still open) conjecture that no polyomino has odd order.
This applies to the plane, but in 3 dimensions the conjecture is false.
The flat heptomino e0e080 has order 28 in the plane, but it has order 9 in 3d.
It fills a box 3 by 3 by 7.
(See solution-3d).
This suggests, to me anyways, that the conjecture might be false in the plane,
we just haven't found a counterexample.
It is feasible to verify order 9 by hand.
Show that orders 2 through 8 aren't possible in the plane.
Since this shape spreads across a 3 by 3 square, it has to fill a box
that is at least 3 by 3, if it is to escape the plane.
The shape consists of 7 squares, so 3 by 3 by 7 is the best we can do.

Question: is there a polyomino with 3d order greater than 8,
whose minimal packing fills a cube? I haven't found one yet.
The stairs packa box that is 5 by 6 by 6 - close, but no cigar.
To construct a 3d example of order 8, start with 8 subcubes to make the larger cube,
and put in tabs and notches so that they all fit together, like this.
e0f0e0!c0e0e040!e0a0e0
Eight of these builds a 6 by 6 by 6 cube.

There are polyominoes in the plane that tile a square, e0e080 for instance,
of order 28, filling a 14 by 14 square.
Make each piece 14 units high in the third dimension, and you have your cube.
Verify with:
	3dbox ff{fc}ff{fc}ff{fc}!ff{fc}ff{fc}!ff{fc}ff{fc} 2
This is somewhat unsatisfying - I'm still looking for a cube that isn't
a vertical extension of a square tiling in the plane.

This from the agile mind of John Conway.
Fill a 3 by 3 by 3 box with 6 pieces: 4 blocks that are 2 by 2 by 1, and 3 unit cubes.
6 times 4 + 3 is 27, so the volume is correct.
You can ask my software to solve it.

3dbox c0c0=6_80=3 3 3 3

However, you can find the solution, and prove it is unique, in your head;
no need for software or even paper and pencil.
Pause here and try to solve.

By a parity argument, each 3 by 3 layer has 1 unit cube, or perhaps 3.
If one layer contains all 3 cubes then there are none left for the other two layers.
Thus each layer has one cube.
The top layer has one cube.
Put it in the center, and four square pieces march around it.
That forces another cube just below the first, two cubes in one layer, a contradiction.
Put the cube in the top layer front and center.
This is bracketed by squares on either side.
There will be another cube below this one, or just behind this one, two cubes in one layer, a contradiction.
Therefore, the cube is in the corner.
Moving to the bottom layer, its cube is in the opposite corner.
The final cube is in the very center, and the unique solution follows from there.

There is work done, and work yet to be done, on pairs of polyominoes that tile
a rectangle, when neither tiles a rectangle on its own.
Does this happen in three dimensions? I don't think it happens often,
or in an interesting way, i.e. order > 10,
though one can easily construct a low-order lock&key example.
Start with a 3 by 3 square, then put a ring of 8 on top of it, then another ring of 8.
This has a hole of depth 2.
Now build a key to go in this lock.
Start with a 3 by 3 square and put a stick of height 2 on the center square.
Neither tiles a box, yet together they have order 2.

The same lock and key mechanism works with just one ring of 8, and a stick
of height 1, though it is less obvious that the latter has order zero.
3dbox e0e0e0!0040 0
gets to diag 4 then no solution.

One can build a pair of order 8.
Piece A is a 3 by 3 by 3 block, with a single cube
attached to the center of the front face, a single cube attached to the
center of the right face, and a single cube attached to the center of the top.
Piece B is a 3 by 3 by 3 block with holes instead of attached cubes.

Here is a pair that isn't lock&key; it isn't constructed for the purpose.
We already proved the twisted octomino has order 0.
See c040!0060 in this directory.
And a ring of 8 obviously has order 0.
Together they have order 8, in a 4 by 4 by 4 box.

Does this 18-omino have order 2?
Start with a 3 by 3 square, then put two bars of width 3 on top
of this square, one at the bottom and one at the top.
Put another bar of length 3 across these two bars, connecting them like abridge.
In my notation, it's e0e0e0!a0a0a0!00e0.
This has order 2, if you don't mind linking the pieces together,
which you can't do with physical pieces in your hand.
This issue never comes up in two dimensions.
So I guess we need to define order carefully.
