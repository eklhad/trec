What is the order of some small 3d polyominoes?

	Volume

If you want to use all three dimensions, the volume has to have
at least 3 prime factors.
If it has exactly 3, p×q×r, then your box is p by q by r.
If there are 4 prime factors, 2 of them join together to make 1 dimension,
and the other prime factors establish the other dimensions.

	Tetrominoes

The line, L, triangle, square, have orders 1, 2, 4, 1,
in the plane or in a flat box, i.e. a box of thickness 1.
The stair tetrominoe has order 6, in a 3 by 2 by 4 box.
The twisted tetromino, our first 3 dimensional piece, has order 2,
and the corner piece has order 2.

	Pentominoes

Start with the 12 flat penominoes.
They are, in my nomenclature: the line, the L, the Y
(you have to tilt it a little to look like a Y), the C, the stairs, the faucet,
the Utah, the lightning bolt, the zigzag, the T, the cross, and the chair.
The line, the L, the Utah, and the Y, have orders 1, 2, 2, and 10.
Can Y do better in a box?
Its order can't be prime, for then the box would be flat.
Order 4 or 6 builds a box that is too skinny.
Even 9 implies 3 by 3, too skinny.
Pieces all stand up against each other and that doesn't work.
8 implies 2 by 4 by 5. Verify this doesn't work, so 10 it is.

C has order 6.

Cross has order 0; it still can't fit into a corner.

When a piece lives in a 3 by 3 square, like the T or faucet or chair,
it can't fill a box of thickness 2.
It would have to tile one layer, then the next layer, so would tile a rectangle,
and we can quickly determine these pentominoes don't tile a rectangle.
Orders 4, 6, 8, and 10 won't work.
At this point I had to resort to software, i.e. 3dbox.c.
The T pentomino has order 60, as follows.
This has a lovely 4-fold rotational symmetry,
plus a vertical symmetry through the three layers.

The stair pentomino has order 36,
the chair has order 18,
the lightning has order 8,
the faucet has order 36,
and the zigzag has order <= 135.
That takes care of the flat penominoes.

As we move to the 3 dimensional pentominoes, chirality comes into play.
For consistency, I allow a piece to be reflected, just as I do in the plane.
If you build a physical model of the puzzle, you have to make left and right
handed versions of the piece, perhaps the correct number of each reflection,
which gives a hint on solving the puzzle.
For example, start with the L tetromino, and place a cube on top
of the end of the long leg, opposite to the short leg.
This is e080!20 in our notation.
It has order 18, using this piece in all its rotations and reflections.
We can place a cube on top of the L tetromino in 3 more ways, giving:
e080!40 order 4, e080!80 order 18, and e080!0080 order 6.
Put a cube atop the triangle tetromino, and e040!0040 has order 10, and e040!40 has order <= 240.
Put a cube atop the stair tetromino, and c060!80 has order 4, and c060!40 has order 28.
Putting a cube atop a 2 by 2 square gives c0c0!80 with order 4.
There are only two penominoes left, the two that do not have 4 cubes in a plane.
These are c080!00c0, with order <= 108,
and c040!0060, which, I believe, has order 0.
My software can't tile the first layer of the box, of any size.
In other words, it can't get off the floor.
Perhaps you can help me develop a formal proof of untilability.

We obviously aren't going to evaluate all the hexominoes, however, the one that
started it all for me in 1987, the Y hexomino, f840, has order 92 in the plane,
and it has order 28 in 3 dimensions, filling a box that is 2 by 7 by 12.

Recall the (still open) conjecture that no polyomino has odd order.
This applies to the plane, but in 3 dimensions the conjecture is false.
The flat heptomino e0e080 has order 28 in the plane, but it has order 9 in 3d.
It fills a box 3 by 3 by 7.
This suggests, to me anyways, that the conjecture might be false in the plane,
we just haven't found a counterexample.
