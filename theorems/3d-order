What is the order of some small 3d polyominoes?

	Volume

If you want to use all three dimensions, the volume has to have
at least 3 prime factors.
If it has exactly 3, p×q×r, then your box is p by q by r.
If there are 4 prime factors, 2 of them join together to make 1 dimension,
and the other prime factors establish the other dimensions.

	Tetrominoes

The line, L, triangle, square, have orders 1, 2, 4, 2,
in the plane or in a flat box, i.e. a box of thickness 1.
The stair tetrominoe has order 6, in a 3 by 2 by 4 box.
The twisted tetromino, our first 3 dimensional piece, has order 2,
and the corner piece has order 2.

	Pentominoes

Start with the 12 flat penominoes.
They are, in my nomenclature: the line, the L, the Y
(you have to tilt it a little to look like a Y), the C, the stairs, the faucet,
the Utah, the lightning bolt, the zigzag, the T, the cross, and the chair.
The line, the L, the Utah, and the Y, have orders 1, 2, 2, and 10.
Can Y do better in a box?
Its order can't be prime, for then the box would be flat.
Order 4 or 6 builds a box that is too skinny.
Even 9 implies 3 by 3, too skinny.
Pieces all stand up against each other and that doesn't work.
8 implies 2 by 4 by 5. Verify this doesn't work, so 10 it is.

C has order 6.

Cross has order 0; it still can't fit into a corner.

When a piece lives in a 3 by 3 square, like the T or faucet or chair,
it can't fill a box of thickness 2.
It would have to tile one layer, then the next layer, so would tile a rectangle,
and we can quickly determine these pentominoes don't tile a rectangle.
Orders 4, 6, 8, and 10 won't work.
At this point I had to resort to software, i.e. 3dbox.c
The T pentomino has order 60, as follows.

The stair pentomino has order 36,
the chair has order 18,
the lightning has order 8,
and the faucet and zigzag are still undetermined.
