I asked Scott Aaronson about polyomino tilings and quantum computing,
and he was kind enough to reply within the hour.
Here is our exchange.

============================================================

A polyomino is a set of squares pasted together to make a particular shape.
One of the interesting questions is whether a polyomino can be used to tile a rectangle.
If so, the smallest number of polyominoes used is the order.
I started playing with this in 1986, and have solved many open tiling problems since then.

A set of polyominoes can also be used.
Here are two hexominoes making a 20 by 120 rectangle, from my github site.

So the order of this pair of hexominoes is <= 400, but probably less.
Tall skinny rectangles are easily packed, due to the boundary conditions.
The problem grows exponentially as the rectangle is closer to square, having the same or lesser area.
The order of this pair is almost certainly less than 400, in a rectangle that is more square,
but I will probably never have the computing power at my hand to determine that.

Finally my question:
Could a quantum computer determine whether a polyomino, or set of polyominoes, packs a given rectangle?
This has no practical applications, it's not like Shore's algorithm, but I still wonder.
I imagine qbits locating each piece on the board, and the patterns constructively interfere if those pieces don't overlap.
Or perhaps qbits draw edges between squares, or not, and interfere if the shapes drawn are all the prescribed polyomino.
Perhaps someone could work on this problem, certainly worthy of a paper.
I know I don't know enough to even get started.

Sincerely,

Karl Dahlke

Hi Karl,

For this problem, like for just about any other combinatorial
optimization problem, I'd expect that a quantum computer could give
you a square-root speedup over what a classical computer can do --
using Grover's algorithm

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm

or variations thereof -- but probably no better than that.

Best,
Scott
