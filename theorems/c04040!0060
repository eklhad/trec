This is an L tetromino with a tab hanging off the middle cube.

Without loss of generality, put the foot of A in the lower left corner,
with A pointing right and the tab heading up.
This forces another piece along the edge.

Skip ahead, and let B be the last piece that protrudes beyond the rightmost
cube of B along the edge.
In other words, B forces another piece, it can't be up against the right wall,
but B is the last piece to do so.

Let B look like A, so that there is a gap of 2 along the edge
under the leg of B.
Let C fill both these ssquares with its foot.
If C faces right then its tab collides with the tab of B.
If C faces left, its tab protrudes, which contradicts the definition of B.

Every piece beyond B has only two possible orientations:
the one we ruled out for C, with its foot against the edge and facing right,
or its tow pointing at the wall and the piece heading left.
This is the orientation for C, as it interlocks with B.
However, D, next to C, can have neither of these orientations.

Put the tab of B against the back wall, as the L component floats above at level 1.
C, next to B, can have neither of the approved orientations.

Put the foot of B against the back wall, with B facing left,
so that its tab floats right.
C, next to B, can have neither of the approved orientations.

Let B lie on the floor and point into the back wall, with B facing left,
so that its tab floats right.
This is the same situation as the previous paragraph.

Finally let B lie on the floor and point into the back wall, with B facing right,
so that its tab floats left.
C, next to B, can have neither of the approved orientations.

That completes the proof.
