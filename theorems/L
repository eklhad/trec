		The L Theorem

An L polyomino is a rectangle with a rectangular notch removed from one corner.
When oriented properly, these resemble the capital letter L,
a large rectangle with a smaller rectangle removed from the upper right.
More often we orient the polyomino so that it lies on its back,
with its foot sticking up. We refer to this polyomino as "lying on its back",
or "face up".

Let the L polyomino have width w and height h, where w >= h.
Remove a y×z rectangle from the upper right corner.
This shape is said to be "lying on its back",
because it is oriented horizontally.
Rotate it 90° counter clockwise and it is "standing up", or "pointing up".

With 4 variables, we need 3 equations to establish the shape. As we place
pieces on the board, we often establish three equations, and thus the shape.
Sometimes an inequality will do the trick,
depending on the section we are in.
You need to keep track of the equations and inequalities that are in force.

	1. L polyominoes of order 2.

If z is half of h or y is half of w, the polyomino has order two.
Henceforth we shall assume z is not half of h and y is not half of w.

	2. Pieces never lie face down on the floor.

If piece a lies face down on the floor, its tab pointing right,
and piece b is immediately to the right of a,
b cannot place its base or back against a,
else the notch of a is permanently isolated.

If b is the 180° rotation of a, it cannot slide its tab under the tab of a
(z < h/2), or the two tabs leave a thin gap (z > h/2).
So the face of b slides under the tab of a.

If there are no gaps anywhere, y = z and z = w-y, hence w = 2y.
This contradicts {1}, so there must be a gap between the tab of a and the notch of b.
This means z = w - y and z > y. In other words, z + y = w, and z is the larger.
z is more than half of w and certainly more than half of h.
With h > z, h is more than half of w. Our shape is not long and skinny.

Only the tab of a piece can fit into the resulting a-b gap of width z-y.
h, w, and w-y are too large.

Let the tab of c fill the corner of a and b.
If c faces left over a, we have a gap of height y - (h-z), or y + z - h, or w - h.
This is smaller than w, and with h more than half of w it is smaller than h.
With h > z > y it is smaller than w-y.
We might try to slide the tab of d between a and c,
but d would lie face up on top of a, the two pieces back to back,
and the tab of d would have to be at least z, to reach c,
but the tab has length y, and z > y.
Therefore a tab cannot slide in between a and c, and there is no gap.
y = h-z, and w = h.
We are dealing with a shape bounded by a square.

If c completely fills the gap above b, z-y = h-z = w-z = y, and the shape is established,
a 3×3 square minus a 1×2 rectangle. This has order 28.
If c and d both point their tabs down into the notch of b,
z-y = 2(h-z) = 2y,
and the shape is established, a 4×4 square minus a 1times3 rectangle.
This is ruled out by trec @f0f0f080.

Finally let c face right. Since d cannot stand next to c facing left,
c fills the gap entirely, giving z - y = h - z, or h + y = 2z.
Now c hangs z-(h-z) squares beyond b. This is y squares beyond b.
Put d on the floor beneath c, and assume d points right. This gives a gap of height w-h.
We dealt with the square shape, w = h, in the last paragraph, giving e0c0c0,
so this gap is real, and must be filled.
Since h is more than half of w it is too large.
w-y > w-z > w-h, so w-y won't fit.
Only a tab can fit, and it must fit precisely, giving 2h-z = w, or 2h = 2z + y.
Combine this with h + y = 2z and find the shape, a 5×4 rectangle minus a 2×3 rectangle.
This is ruled out by trec @f8e0e0e0.

If d faces b there is a gap between b d and c that can't be filled.
If d points toward b, and e fits in the corner of b and d,
e and d can't interlock, as that would give a piece of order 2, or create holes.
e faces b, giving h-z + w-y = w.
This reduces to h = w, which we dealt with.
Therefore d stands back-to-back against b.

Verify that d cannot point down; its notch could not be completely filled by e.
h > z > y, so e can't point right.
If e points left then h-z = y, or h = w, which is the square again.
Thus d stands up, the reflection of b.

If c is flush with the tab of d, then 2(h-z) = z, or 2h = 3z.
Combine this with h + y = 2z and find e0c0c0 again.

If c extends beyond the tab of d, we have a gap of height y to fill.
w and h don't work, and w-y yields order 2.
Thus h-z = y, and we have the square again.

Thus c does not reach the edge of d.
Place e in the corner of c and d,
and note that e cannot point down and wrap around d, as z is more than half of h, and more than h-z.
Neither can e point to c and wrap around d, as y is more than h-z.
e must not extend past the right of d, else we have a gap of height y, as described in the last paragraph.
The tab presents the smallest edge, of length h-z,
and that is the same as the top of d, so would be pushed to the right by c.

Henceforth we can assume that a piece never lies face down on the floor,
or faces the left or right wall.

	3. Square pieces never point down onto the floor.

The only requirement in {2} is that w >= h,
so redefine the roles of h and w, and the piece is lying face down on the floor,
which we already analyzed.

	4. Pieces cannot point down on the floor when y < h.

Let a point down onto the floor,
and clearly, b cannot put its blunt end under a.
b cannot slide its face into the notch of a,
else the shape has order 2.
Thus b points into a.
We may also assume w > h by {3}.

b has to fill the notch of a, thus h-z = y.

If there is no gap between a and b at level y,
y = z, and h = 2z, giving a shape of order 2.
So we have a gap of width y-z in the notch of b.
This puts z < y < h.

Place c in the corner of a and b.
This must be the face or tab of c.
Suppose c lies face down and points left, extending over the top of a.
If z = w - y then we have a square (h=w).
If z > w - y then z > h - y, yet z = h - y.
Therefore c points right, and completely fills the a-b gap,
giving w - y = y - z.
This is a b c interlock,
where c extends z squares beyond b.
Put d on the floor below c.
If d faces left it must fit exactly, giving w - y = h.
Yet w - y = y - z, so h = y - z, which contradicts y < h.
Instead, d must lie down and point right.
We already know z + y = h, hence z < w - y. Thus c does not reach the notch of d.
Place e in the corner of c and d.
If e extends beyond the face of d we have a gap of height z, between d and e,
that cannot be filled by f without crashing into e or creating holes with d or with the floor.
e can't point down and wrap around d, since z < y.
e can't lie face down and point left and interlock with d, because e would crash into c. We already saw that the tabs extend outward from such an interlock.
Therefore, c cannot lie face down atop b.

We now know that c points down onto b.
If c faces right, its tab fills the entire gap, giving y - z = h - z, or y = h.
So c faces left, d stands back-to-back against c, and 2(h-z) = y-z.
this implies 2h = y  +  z, yet y + z is h.
That takes care of c, and b, hence a cannot point down.

	5. Small notch: y < h/2 and z < h/2.

Suppose our shape has a small notch, y and z are both less than half of h.
Let a tile the origin - the lower left corner of the tiled rectangle.
By {4}, its back must be placed against the floor or the left wall.
We can always reflect the tiled rectangle, so assume a lies on its back,
its notch at the upper right. piece b,
immediately to the right of a on the floor,
cannot place its back or base against a, else the notch cannot be filled.

Suppose b stands up and faces left.
If the two notches do not coincide in height,
one or the other will create a gap that cannot be filled. Thus h - z = w - y.
It is possible that w = h and y = z,
but this square in a square will be handled in the next paragraph.
For now, assume w > h, hence y > z. This is illustrated by a 8×7 rectangle
with a 3×2 notch removed. The a-b gap has width y + z,
which is strictly less than h. It must be filled by a tab of width w-y or h-z (same thing).
Assume c lies on top of a, and the two are 180° rotations of each other.
We say that a and c are "interlocked".
A rectangular space now exists between c and the left wall, just above a.
Its width is w - 2y and its height is h - z.
Rewrite w - 2y as h-z - y, a width considerably smaller than h,
and even smaller than the tab h-z. Nothing can fill this space.
Thus c stands up, with its tab pointing down into the a-b gap.
If c faces left there is a gap between a and the overhang of c,
having height y-z. This is clearly unfillable, unless y = z (no gap),
but we're assuming y > z, so let's move on.
Let c face right and interlock with b.
The rectangular space between c and the left wall now has width w - y and height w - z.
A tab of width w - y can indeed slide into this space,
but in order to reach all the way down to a, w - z must be <= y or z.
If y+z is at least w then y+z exceeds h, which contradicts (y and z) < h/2.
Thus b does not stand up next to a.

Since b does not stand up next to a, it must lie down on the flor,
the horizontal reflection of a.
This presents a 2y×z gap which will be filled by the face or tab of c.
Suppose c is horizontal, hence 2y = w - y, or w = 3y.
If c points left then the space between c and the left wall has width y,
and cannot be filled. If c points right then this space has width 2y,
just like the a-b gap. Since 2y < h,
only a tab or face can slide into this space.
Yet the space has height h - z, which is longer than y or z.

Now c points down, its tab filling the double notch.
This implies 2y = h - z. The vertical gap between c and (a or b)
has height y - z, which implies y >= z.
Nothing fits into a gap of height y, much less y-z, so y equals z.
Combined with the last equation, y = z = h/3. That is, h = 3z.
If w = h, a situation that was postponed before, we have established the shape,
a 3×3 square minus a 1×1 square.
This is ruled out by trec @e0e0c0, hence w > h.

Place d on top of a, at the left wall, in the gap of width w - y - z and height w - y.
Since y and z are both smaller than w - y, d cannot point down or face down
without crashing into c or creating an unfillable gap.
d stands up and faces right.
Any other pieces between d and c must also stand up.
If there is an adjacent piece e with its back to d,
the d-e gap can only be filled with the tab of f,
as w - y > h - z, (remembering w > h and y = z),
and f creates holes against the left wall.
e faces d,
creating a double notch that is filled by f.
d and e mean w is at least 2h + z, so w - y is at least 2h.
The face of f won't fit in this gap.
Nor two tabs, since h-z is more than half of h.
Put the tab of f in this d-e gap.
If f faces left the space between f and the left wall, h - 2z = z,
is too small. If f faces right the gap is h-z,
so the tab of g might slide in, but then y >= w - y, which contradicts 2y < h.
Thus d is the lone vertical piece.

If c faces left then w - y = h + z, or w = h + 2y.
This establishes the shape, a 5×3 rectangle minus a 1×1 square,
which is handled as a separate theorem f8f8f8e0.
Thus c faces right, and w-y = h. This establishes the shape,
a 4×3 rectangle minus a 1×1 square. This polyomino has order 50.
That completes the analysis of the small notch, with (y and z) < h/2.

	6. Tall thin notch: y < h/2 and z > h/2.

Thanks to {2} and {4}, a lies on the floor, its notch at the upper right.
Put b on the floor next to a.
If b has its back to a, or its left end to a, that tall thin notch can't be filled.
Tab is not long enough; face is too wide.
Suppose b is the reflection of a,
and presents a double notch that will be filled by c.
Unfortunately the tab of c isn't long enough to do the job.
But c might lie face down, if 2y = w - y. That is, w = 3y.
If c points left then the space between c and the left wall has width y,
which can only be filled if h - z = y.
Slide d into this slot, facing right,
and let e fill the corner created by c and d,
having width w-z and height 2y.

If e points up we must compare w - z and h (which is y+z).
Sinze z > y, 3y - z < y + z.
Thus e extends beyond c, over b, producing a gap of height h-z.
An even longer gap is produced if e lies on its back.
Let f slide its tab between e and b.
We can't afford any gaps between e and f, so w - z + y is either w or h.
The former forces y = z (contrary to our assumptions),
and the latter implies 4y = h+z = y+z+z, or 3y = 2z.
This establishes the shape, a 6×5 rectangle minus a 2×3 rectangle,
which is ruled out by trec @fcfcf0f0f0.

If e points down into the c-d corner, and its tab does not cover all of c,
we find a ((w-z)-(h-z))×y gap.
If w = h we find the now-familiar shape e0e080 of order 28.
With w > h we have a gap to fill.
Even if f could fill this gap with its tab,
lying face down, it would crash into b.

Next, e might point down and face d, wrapping around c, whence w - z = z.
Thus 2z = 3y, building the same shape we saw before, fcfcf0f0f0.

That brings us to the last orientation of e, lying face down.
Since w - y > w - z, e still extends beyond c.
Once again we ask the tab of f to slide under without gaps,
forcing w-z + y = w-y, or 2y = z. This gives our order 28 shape again.
That takes care of c pointing left.

Next let c point right. Since 2y < h,
d places its face or tab in the gap above a.
If its tab is down, then 2y = h-z, and the tab cannot reach all the way down to a.
So d is the vertical reflection of a.
Let e fill the gap between c and the tab of d.
Thus 2z-h is either 2y or h-z.
Assume the former, hence z-y is half of h.
The gap between the tabs of d and e is z-y, or half of h.
Since 3y is at least h, 2y is more than half of h,
so let the tab of f fill the corner of d and e.
If f faces left we can't afford a gap between d and f, hence y = h-z.
This makes y ¼ of h and z ¾ of h, whence 3y < h, hence w < h,
which is impossible.
Thus f faces right and its tab fills the entire gap,
hence h-z = h/2, giving a shape of order 2.

Therefore e lies on its back across c, and 2z - h = h-z, or z = 2h/3.
Remember that y is at least h/3, else h < w.
If y is exactly h/3 we create a shape we've seen before, of order 28,
so assume y > h/3. Remember that y < h/2.
If f, above d, points up,
we have a gap of width w-h = 3y-h, which is smaller than y.
If filled by the tab of g, we have 3y = 4h/3, or 9y = 4h.
This establishes the shape, a 12×9 rectangle minus a 4×6 rectangle.
It also produces a thin gap of height 1 between e and g that cannot be filled.
Therefore, f lies back-to-back atop d.

f can't point left because of its tall thin gap, so f points right.
Place g above f.
If g stands up or lies on its back we have a gap of height z.
2y is too large, and h-z is too small,
so g is the vertical reflection of f. The double notch has height 2z.
If h stands up in this double notch we will not be able to fill the notch of
h, because of the tab of g, which is longer than h-z.
Nor can h face left, because 2y < 2z.
We must fill the double notch with two horizontal pieces,
reaffirming 2z = h + h-z. Once h and i are placed,
i extends above the top surface of g.
This is exactly the same pattern we saw 2h rows below.
By induction, pieces climb up the left wall forever.
That completes the case of b lying down and pointing towards a.

At this point b stands up and faces left.
Note that w-y >= h-y > h-z, so the notch of a is lower,
and must be filled first. Since w-y > y,
only the thin tab of c can fill the notch of a. In fact c and b interlock.
Thus y = h-z. Also, h-z + y = w-y, or w = 3y.
z can't be more than twice y, else h > w.
z is greater than y by the assumptions of this section.
When z = 2y we find e0e0c0 again.
Thus z is strictly between y and 2y.
That puts y between h/3 and h/2.

Piece d filss the space between c and the left wall, just above a.
h-z is smaller than 2y, and leavs a gap,
so pieces d and a are vertical reflections.
This gives a gap between c and the tab of d of height 2z-3y.
If there is no gap, we have 2z = 3y.
This establishes the shape, fcfcf0f0f0, which we saw before.
So there is a real gap, filled by the tab of e.
If 2z-3y = h-z = y, then z is twice y, which has already been handled.
This completes the case of b standing up.

When this result is combined with {5}, we can assume, hereinafter,
that y is at least h/2.

	7. y = h/2.

Assume w > h, else the shape has order 2.
That means w-y > y.
We can't put the face of a shape in a gap of width y.

Remember that {2} and {4} rule out certain orientations.
Let a lie on the floor and point right.
Put b on the floor next to a.
If b has its back or left end next to a, there is a y by z gap to fill.
Even if b faces a, we still have a gap of width y to fill.
Only the tab of c might fit into this gap.
If two tabs, then 2(h-z) = h/2, or 3h = 4z.
Now the tab of c isn't long enough to reach down into the notch of a.
If one tab, then h-z = h/2, or h = 2z. This has order 2.

b is the reflection of a, and presents a double notch of size h×z.
Suppose c fills this double notch, or at least the left side of it,
by lying face down, whence w - y <= h.
Equivalently, w - h <= y.
If c points left then the space between c and the left wall has width w-2y = w-h <= y.
The tab of d must precisely fill this gap.
To reach down to a, y is at least h - z, thus z >= h/2.
In fact z > h/2.
There is a gap of height z-y between d and c.
The tab of e isn't long enough to reach the notch of d.

Therefore, c points right, and w-y is precisely h.
Our shape is a square with a tab attached.
The space between c and the left wall now has width h, the side of the square.
If d fills this space, and is the vertical reflection of a,
there must be a gap between c and the tab of d, (since z cannot be half of h).
This gap has height 2z-h, which forces z > h/2.
The gap is filled by the tab of e, hence 2z-h = h-z, or 3z = 2h.
This establishes the shape, a 9×6 rectangle minus a 3×4 notch.
See theorems/ff+ff+fcfcfcfc.

If we still want c to point right, d must point up the left wall.
Let e fill the corner of c and d.
If e presents a flat side, any side, against d,
the notch of d cannot be filled.
A piece pointing down into this notch crashes into the left wall or leaves a tall thin gap with the left wall.
If e lies face down and points left,
if will perfectly wrap around d. This because h+z = h+z.
Tabs must not collide, so z > h/2.
This leaves a gap between d and e and once again a piece points its tab
down into the notch of d, and crashes into the left wall
or leaves a gap with the left wall.

Finally e lies back-to-back atop c, and points towards d.
If d and e are flush then z is half of h, which gives an order of 2.
Since the pieces are not flush, we have a gap above d or e,
of width z or y respectively, that cannot be filled.
That's it for e, and d, and c lying face down.

Since w > h, c cannot lie on its back inside the double notch,
and we can't fit two downward tabs precisely in the double notch (z would be half of h),
and one tab doesn't fill the entire gap,
so c stands up.
Where is the notch of c, relative to the height of a and b?
If the notch is lower than h, we have w-y + h-z < h, or y+z > w.
Thus y+z > h and z is bigger than y.
Piece d could lie face down in the notch of c, pointing over the tab of c -
we know there's room across c.
Yet this leaves a square gap of side z-(w-y).
It's a real gap, since y+z > w.
With w-y at least h/2, the face of e won't fit into this gap.
Only the tab of e can fill this gap.
Since 2z > y+z > w, e can't lie face down without crashing into  a or b (depending on which way c faces).
e is face up, and one tab fills the gap.
The gap between e and a or b is too long and narrow to be filled.
If you try to slide a piece in it crashes into e, or a or b.

We must use tabs to fill the notch of c.
One thin tab cannot fill the notch, since h-z is less than half of h.
If two thin tabs fill the notch, 2(h-z) = z, or 2h = 3z.
w floats between h and 7/6 of h.
one of the two pieces, facing away from the tab of c,
creates a gap of width z and height w-z.
Only a tab can slide in, and it isn't long enough to close the gap.
That completes the notch of c below the a-b line.

Suppose the notch of c is flush with its neighbor, hence w-y = z.
z is still bigger than y, so that w can be bigger than h.
If c faces right, the space between c and the left wall has width z,
and can only be filled by the vertical reflection of a.
Since 2z > y+z, there is a gap between the tabs of c and d,
which is h-z by z-y.
Only a tab can fit, and e can't face down, else it crashes into c.
This leaves a long narrow gap above c and b of height y that cannot be filled.
So c faces left, and the space between c and the left wall has width 2z.

Let d sit atop a, against the left wall.
If d lies on its back, the gap between the tabs of d and c has width z-y.
Only a downward pointing tab is thin enough to slide in.
e can't face left, or it crashes into d, so just one tab, with e facing right.
z-y = h-z. z is 3/4 of h.
This establishes the shape, f8e0e0e0, which we've seen before.

If d lies face down, d and c create an enclosed space that can't be filled.

If d points down, the gap between d and a can't be filled.

Finally d stands up along the left wall.
The gap between d and the tab of c has width 2z-h.
Only a tab fits, one tab, as e faces right.
Thus 2z-h = h-z, or z = 2h/3.
This establishes the shape, a 7×6 rectangle minus a 3×4 rectangle.
This is ruled out by trec @fefef0f0f0f0.

At this point, the notch of c rises above a and b.
In other words, w-y > z.

Let d, just to the left of c, lie down on top of a,
the vertical reflection of a,
and suppose c faces right.
We know w > y+z, and if y > z, w > 2z,
whence c won't fit.
z can't equal y, half of h,
so y < z, and the tab of d extends beyond the tab of c.
Place e in the gap between the two tabs.
This gap has height 2z - w, which is less than z-y.
Only the tab of e can fit.
e can't face down or it crashes into c.
Thus we have a long narrow gap between e and c+b that can't be filled.

So c faces left and d wraps around c, giving 2z = w-y.
If z < h/2, the tabs of c and d collide.
Thus z > h/2, and there is a gap between the tabs of d and c of width z-y.
Let the tab of e fill the corner where c and d meet.
If e faces left, there is a gap between d and e that cannot be filled.
So e faces right and interlocks with the tab of c, and z = 3h/4.
This establishes the shape, an 8×4 rectangle minus a 2×3 rectangle.
This is ruled out by trec @fffcfcfc.
That's the end of d lying down.

If d points down onto a, and c faces right, y+z = w; yet w > y+z.
If c faces left, y+z = w-y, and h-z = w-y, hence y+2z = h.
This establishes the shape, f8f8f8e0, which we've seen before.

Finally let d point up along the left wall.
If there is a gap between d and c above a, it is filled by the tab of e.
e can't face left or it perfectly interlocks with d, giving order 2.
If e faces right then the gap between d ane is filled by two pieces pointing down,
and the left piece crashes into the left wall.
There is no gap, and w-y = h.

Suppose c faces d, d standing z ssquares higher than c.
With w-y > z, only the thin tab can be used to fill the notch of c.
In fact we must use two of them, one facing left, and that forces y = z. Yet z can't equal h/2.
Thus c faces right.
d still stands z squares higher than c.
If z < y, the bracketed notch of d cannot be filled, hence z > y.
Let e fill the corner where c and d meet.
If e presents a straight left vertical edge, it brackets the notch of d,
which cannot be filled.
If e presents a straight horizontal edge, beyond the tab of c,
the notch of c cannot be filled.
The only way to save the situation is for e to point down and face left,
and interlock with d.
This gives y = z-y, which is impossible.
That's it for d, and c rising above the landscape.

We've placed the notch of c below, at, and above the a-b line,
and made no progress. Thus b does not point towards a.
Instead, b stands up and faces a.

If the notch of b is higher than the tab of a,
the gap of width h/2 cannot be filled.
One tab sets h-z = y.
Two tabs forces c to face left and hang over a,
which sets z = y, or makes a thin gap between a and c of height y-z, which could not be filled.

Suppose they are flush, hence h-z = w-y.
thus h-z >= h-y, and z <= y.
Since z can't equal y, z < y.
This in turn makes w > h.

The gap is y+z, which is less than h. Place c in the notch of a.
It can't stand up, and its tab won't precisely reach the notch of a,
so c lies face down.
If it points right, its tab crashes into b, which is standing up.
Thus c points left across a.
If c is a perfect fit in the gap we have w-y = y+z.
This establishes the shape, f8f8f8e0, which we have seen before.
whose disposition is unknown. If we need to supplement with the tab of d,
we have w-y + h-z = y+z, which forces 2z = w, and w becomes smaller than h.

Finally let the notch of b remain lower than the tab of a, whence w-y < h-z.
Clearly y has to be larger than z, to make up for the fact that w exceeds h.
Now w-y, which is larger than y, is larger than z,
so the face of c will not fit into the notch of b.
Nor will the tab, since h-z > z.
That takes care of b standing next to a.

Those are all the cases for this section.
With {5}, {6}, and {7} behind us,
we can assume y > h/2.

	8. y < h, c points down in the notch of a and faces left

Let's see how far we get with y between h/2 and h.
{2} and {4} are in effect, so put a in the corner, face up and pointing right,
and put b on the floor next to a.
Without regard to b, put the tab of c in the notch of a, with c facing left.
If y > z then there is a thin gap between c and a. It is z by y-z.
h-z is bigger than y-z, so no tabs in this gap.
If d faces c interlocked then w-y = y-z.
Yet with d standing on a, w-y >= h.
This is a contradiction, so there is no thin gap between a and c, and y = z.
The piece has a square bite taken out of it.

If c reaches the left wall we have w-y = y, giving a shape of order 2.
So we have a gap of w-2y by w-y to fill.

If the gap is less than h across,
neither tab nor face, of length y, can reach down to a, so w-2y is at least h.

All pieces between c and the left wall stand up.
If there are two or more, they create a gap at level h+w-y that can't be filled by a face, as the face of a below is longer.
If d and e stand front to back, the square gap can't be filled by one tab,
order 2, or two tabs, the leftmost piece crashing into the left wall.
If d and e face each other, two tabs imply order 2,
and one tab makes z = h/3.
By assumption, z is more than half of h.
Therefore d is entirely sufficient.
w-y = h+y.

Let d point up the left wall and place e on top of d.
If e is anything other than the reflection of d,
we have a square notch to fill, similar to the notch of a.
This can only be done with tabs, two tabs in fact,
but then the bottom tab isn't long enough to reach across c into d.
So e points down, and f fills the notch of d.
If f stands up its face must fill the double notch perfectly.
This sets w = 3y, yet the height of d is w-2y, setting h = y.
Thus f points right.
If f fills the gap perfectly then 2y = h.
There has to be more room, so slide the tab of g in between e and f.
Now 2y = h + h-y.
y is 2/3 of h.
This establishes the shape, a 7 by 3 rectangle minus a 2 by 2 square.
This is ruled out by trec @fef8f8.
That takes care of c facing left.

	9. y < h, c lies face down in the notch of a

Let c face down in the notch of a.
Since w-y is not y, it's not a perfect fit.
If w-y < y, and c points left, its tab crashes into the left wall.
If c points right, we wonder what to put in the gap between the tabs of a and c.

It can't be one tab, else z = h-z.
It can't be two tabs, else the face of the lower piece crashes into the floor.
If it is a face, then w-y <= z.
h-y <= z, and h-z <= y.
b can't point down unless h-z = y.
Looking across the tab of a, y = w-y + z.
w = 2y - z.
If b perfectly fills the gap, w-y = z, or w = y+z.
y+z = 2y -z.
z is half of y.
This is e0e080, order 28.
If two faces fill the gap, the top piece has the tab of c running toward its notch, whence z >y,
which contradicts y > half of h.
If a tab slides in between b and c, z = w-y + h-z.
thus z = w, which is impossible.
So this piece, call it d, points up, and fills the gap perfectly, whence w-y = z.
Looking at the tab of c, z >= y.
Suppose z > y, and there is a gap between the tabs.
w-y is z and that won't fit.
if one tab fits in then h-z + y is z.
h = 2z - y.
If two tabs then 2h = 3z - y.
h + w-y > y, so d extends well beyond the tab of a, leaving a gap with the floor.
Put a face in this gap, of height w-y, which is z,
and with z >= y, z is more than half of h, and higher than h-z.
The tab of b slides in, and is naturally the proper height.
Is it long enough?
We must exactly fill h+w-2y, or h+z-y.
In other words, h+z-2y = 0.
With one tab between c and d, h was 2z-y.
y = z, but then there is no gap between the tabs of c and d.
Two tabs:2h = 3z - y.
Again y = z.
Therefore there is no gap between the tabs of c and d, and y = z.
Remember that h + z -2y = 0, so h = y, which is impossible.
A face does not sit in the corner of a and c.
That takes care of w-y < y.

With w-y > y, c extends beyond the tab of a,
and b has to slide in along the floor.
If it is the face of b then h-z = w-y and w-y = y+z.
h = 2z + y.
z is less than a quarter of h, and certainly less than y.
c cannot point right; its tab would crash into b.
c points left, and the gap above a is w-2y by h-z.
Clearly a face won't fit, since the span of a is w-y.
With w-2y = z, a piece can't stand up.
The tab of d fills the gap, and h-z = w-2y.
Yet h-z = w-y, whence y = 0.
The face of b does not slide in under c;
it is the tab of b, which is of course the proper height.
2y is at least w-y.
If it is more, then one tab fits into the notch of b, giving 2y = w-y + h-z.

Let c point left, giving a gap of width w-2y above a.
With w-y <= 2y, w-2y <= y.
One tab fills this gap, thus w-2y = h-z.
If c does not completely fill the double notch then h-z = 2y - (w-y).
5y = 2w 
Go back to h-z = w - 2y and replace w = 5y/2, and h-z = y/2.
There is a gap between the tab of c and the face of d.
The tab of e fits this gap perfectly.
e lies atop c, and they are vertical reflections.
If there is no gap between the faces of e and d, then y = z.
y = z = 2h/3.
This is f8e0e0, order 270.
A gap between the faces is filled by a tab.
This gives another gap between faces, filled by a tab, and pieces go up and to the right forever.
Or, write y-z = h-z, whence h = y.

Keep c pointing left, but let it fill the double notch, whence w-y = 2y.
The tab of d still points down onto a, giving h-z = y.
y > z.
The corner of c and d is w-z by w-y.

Put e in this corner.
Let e lie face up atop c.
e extends z squares to the right of c.
Slide the tab of f into this gap.
f is face up, and if there is no gap between the faces then y = z.
That puts y at half of h, so there is a gap of width y-z.
y-z = h-z, or 2(h-z); these are dead ends.

Let e lie face down and find a gap of height z between c and the tab of e.
One tab can't fill this gap, else h-z = z.
Two tabs means f wraps perfectly around c, and h-z = z.

Let e point down onto c.
d and e consume h squares across c.
h = y+z < w = y+y+y.
There is a gap of height y to fill.
Two tabs means f wraps around c, as in the last paragraph.
One tab means f lies face up.
f extends h beyond c.
The gap between b and f is longer than y, and can't be filled.

e stands up in the corner of c and d.
d and e consume h+z squares across c.
This leaves 2y-2z squares of c.
Put f in the corner of c and e.
If f is face up the thin gap between b and f can't be filled.
If f is face down then add up z + h + w-y and subtract w, giving h+z-y.
This is 2z, so if g slides its tab between b and f, y = 2z.
y = 2h/3 and z = h/3.
This is fcfcf0, which fails.
If f points left and wraps around c, then 2z = h.
If f points down and wraps around c, then 2y - 2z = z.
Let f point down onto c, with its back to e.
The span across c is z + h + h-z, or 2h, or 2y+2z.
If f and c are flush then y = 2z.
This is fcfcf0 again.
As y is greater or less than 2z, we have a gap of height y to fill,
to the right of f or to the right of c.
Fill this with the tap of g pointing left.
It's tab is h-z high which is perfectly y.
If next to c then g is face up.
w+y is always larger than 2y+2z, so there is
a gap between f and g, and blocked above by the face of f, thus unfillable.
Put g against f and g can't lie face up,
or the long narrow gap between b and g can't be filled.
g wraps perfectly around c, but then z = h-z.
The last and only orientation for f is standing up along side e.
Compare z+h+h with w, the width of c.
If they are equal then 3z = y.
This puts y at 3/4 of h.
The shape is ff+ff+ff+fc, which fails.
Let f extend beyond c and slide the tab of g under f.
If there is no gap between f and g then z+h+h = w+y, or 3z = 2y.
This is ff+ff+ff+fcfc, which we've seen before.
So there is a gap, filled by the tab of h, but that makes f and c flush again.
Finally suppose f does not make it all the way to the end of c.
3z < y so z is pretty small.
Place g in the corner of c and f.
Face up, and the long gap above b can't be filled.
Same for face down and pointing right.
If g points left it wraps around c, and h-z = z.
Let g point down and face left and wrap around c.
Now z + h + h + z = w, or 4z = y.
This is a 12 by 5 rectangle minus a 4 by 1 rectangle.
In our notation this is ff{c0}ff{c0}ff{c0}ff{c0}ff.
treck can't tile rectangles with polyominoes more than 9 squares across,
however, the first quadrant diagonal test can handle pieces 16 squares across.
This one fails.
If you don't trust the computer, look at e and f.
If the aren't back to back there is a thin gap between them that can't be filled.
So e faces left but then there is a gap above d that can't be filled.
Let g point down and face right.
z + h + h + h-z > w and g extends beyond c, so the tab of h slides under the tab of g.
Again if g meets the face of h then c and f were flush in the first place.
There's a gap between g and h and blocked above by the face of g,
that can't be filled.
g can only stand up, like f and e.
z + h + h + h is of course > 3y and > w, so g goes well beyond c.
Slide the tab of h between b and g.
If the faces of g and h meet then 4z = y, which gives a shape we've seen before.
Leave enough room for the tab of i, and
z + h + h + h + h-z = 4y.
4h can't equal 4y.

Now let's unwind the stack.
That was the last orientation for g, the last orientation for f,
the last orientation for e, the only orientation for d.
and the end of c lying face down in the notch of a and pointing left.

Let c lie down and point right.
Remember that the face of c extends beyond a, and b slides its tab beneath c.
We took care of c having a short face, and b putting its face under c, before.

A gap between b and c is enclosed, so there is no gap. w-y = 2y.

Put d above a and note that d cannot lie face up.

Let d point down; if it fills the gap above a then h-z = w-y = 2y.
h-z < h and 2y > h so this doesn't work.
Nor can we put a piece next to d, so d does not point down.

Let d stand up atop a.
If d fills the gap then h = 2y, which doesn't work.
If e stands next to d then 2h <= 2y, which doesn't work.
e must point down, putting its back against d.
In the notch of d is a z by y gap to fill.
One tab sets h-z = z.
Two tabs causes the left piece to crash into the wall.

The last orientation for d is the vertical reflection of a.
If d wraps perfectly around c, then 2z = h.
This is order 2, so 2z > h, and there is an h-2z gap between c and the tab of d.
Put the tab of e in the gap, with e lying atop c.
2z = h + h-z, or 3z = 2h.
That's the second equation; we still don't know the ratio of w to h.

Put f in the corner of b and c.
If f points left and wraps around b, there is a gap of width 2y along the floor that can't be filled.
If f points down and wraps around b then y = z.
This is fcf0f0, with order 396.

Let f point down onto b.
h-z is h/3, which is less than y,
so there is a gap of height y between b and the face of f.
One tab sets y = h-z, whence y is too small, so put in two tabs.
y = 2(h-z), y is 2/3 of h, y = z, and we're back to fcf0f0.

Let f stand up.
f extends beyond b, and g lies on the floor next to be, under f, pointing right.
f can't extend y squares beyond b, or h >= 2y.
Let h stand next to f.
If they are face to back, there is a z by y notch to fill.
One tab sets h-z = z, and two tabs produces fcf0f0 again.
If they face each other there is a 2z by y gap to fill.
A piece standing up in the gap sets h = 2z.
A piece standing and a tab sets 2z = h + h-z, whence h = z.
A piece lying down sets y = 2z/3.
Since z = 2/3 of h, y is less than half of h.
Put a face in the gap and 2y = 2z.
A face and a tab means 2y + h-z = 2z.
This means 2y = 2h - h.
Two tabs sets h-z = z.
One tab sets h-z = 2z, whence z is only a third of h.
Those are all the choices, so pieces do not stand facing each other.
They must stand back to back,
and it follows that three pieces can never stand next to each other.
So f and h stand back to back.
If h is flush with the face of g then 2h = 3y. This sets y = z, which we already handled.
If h goes beyond the face of g there is a gap of height z,
which we can't fill with one tab, or two.
thus h doesn't quite reach across, and 2h < w.
Well something has to be flush with the face of g, or something has to wrap around g,
or we get that same gap that can't be filled.
If a piece wraps around the face of g then 3y = 2h+y or 2h+z. These give h <= y.
If a tab tries to make a flush edge with the face of g then 3y = 2h + h-z.
y = 7h/9.
This is a 21 by 9 rectangle minus a 7 by 6 rectangle.
Well that's beyond anything trec can handle.
We have to continue by hand.
There is a gap of height 13 between g and i.
It is 7 across on the bottom and 6 across on top.
Try some combinations and you'll see it cannot be filled.
So h doesn't stand next to f.
h can't be horizontal or it goes well past the face of g - unless it is face down and interlocks.
This sets h+y = 3y, which doesn't work.
So h is vertical, and points down.
If h faces left and wraps around g then h+z = 3y. y = 5h/9, which is just above half.
However, there is a very thin gap between the tabs of g and h, height h/9, that can't be filled.
So h points down and faces right.
f and h span 4h/3.
This can't go past the face of g, and can't even be flush with
the face of g, since y would be 4/9 of h, which is less than half.
Back up, and let f point down.
f must face right, giving a gap of height y.
One tab or two, y is h/3 or 2h/3, we've seen this before.
f lies face up across b and g, and is flush with the face of g.
If f points left there is another gap of width y, no good.
So f points right.
Now put h in the notch of g.
If h rises above the tab of f we have another gap of width y.
Some exploring will convince you the only orientation for h is face down
pointing right, with i below h interlocked.
If i touches the right wall we have a gap of width y above i,
so things must continue.
g i and h look rather like a b and c.
Put j in the corner of h and i,
and if j is face up pointing right the pattern repeates.
Most of the other orientations lead to contradictions, as we saw with f.
j could wrap around the tab of h; that wasn't possible with f.
This sets h-z equal to z, or y, and those don't work.
Therefore j lies down and points left.
That is the orientation that stops the repeating pattern.
Put k below j pointing right.
Put l on the floor next to k.
A gap of y is not allowed, and l can't point down or face down to wrap around k,
so l points left.
Put m in the notch of k.
If m is face down pointing right, k m l looks like a b c, and we repeat.
m has to do something else.
Specifically, m has to stand up.
If it fills the gap then h = 2y.
If it joins the tab of n to fill the gap then 4h/3 = 2y.
This sets y = z, which we've seen before.

Unwind the stack, and d is not the reflection of a,
this was the last orientation for d, c does not point right,
and c cannot lie face down in the notch of a.

	10. y < h, b points right or faces right

Put b on the floor next to a.
If b faces right or points right there is a gap of width y.
c cannot lie face down in this gap, or point down facing left.
We have ruled those out.
If c points down facing right then it fills the gap, thus y = h-z.
z is less than half of h.
d, above a, can't be the vertical reflection of a, because 2z is not h, and certainly not w.
The face of c is y + h-z off the floor, or if you prefer, 2y off the floor.
If b faces right then 2y >= w, hence w-y <= y.
We need equality, so d can point its tab down onto a.
Now z+y is at least w, but z+y = h, so h = w.
The outline of our shape is a square.
There is a y-z gap between b and c.
A tab of thickness h-z = y won't fit.
Only a face might, if w-y = y-z. That is, h-y = y-z.
Thus 2z = y.
This is e0e080.
That's it for b facing right.

Let b point right, and as we saw above, c points down and faces right.
y + z is still h, and z is less than half of h.
d, above a, can't be the vertical reflection of a, because 2z is not h, and certainly not w.
The face of c is y + h-z off the floor, or if you prefer, 2y off the floor.
There is a y-z gap between b and c.
A tab of thickness h-z = y won't fit.
Only a face might, if w-y = y-z.
So the gap above a is y -z across.
d can't stand up in this gap, and we already ruled out the vertical reflection.
d points down, and y+z is at least w.
But y+z = h, so w = h.
We're back to e0e080.
That's it for b pointing right.

	11. y < h, b faces left

Let b face left.
Again, c points down into the notch of a and faces right.
Either c and b interlock, or the tab of c fills the combined gap of a and b.
Let's consider the latter case.
h-z = w-y,
and h-z = y+z.
z is less than a quarter of h.
d, above a, can't be the vertical reflection of a, because 2z is not h, and certainly not w.
With w-y < h, d can't stand atop a.
d points down onto a, which is consistent with h-z = w-y.
z+y is at least w.
However, z+y is less than h.
That takes care of the rather strange case of the tab of a flush with the face of b.

c and b interlock.
c fills the notch of a, so that h-z = y.
z is still less than y.
The face of c is y + h-z off the floor, or if you prefer, 2y off the floor.
The face of b fills this gap, so that w-y = 2y.
The gap above a is 2y across, which is more than h.
d, above a, can't be the vertical reflection of a, because 2z is not h, and certainly not w.
d can't point down because nothing can fill the gap between d and a.
d stands up, leaving a gap of 2y-h between d and c.
This gap is y-z by 2y.
Nothing is long and skinny enough to fill this gap.
That takes care of b facing left.

	12. y < h, b points left

The last case is b pointing left, creating a double notch that is 2y by z.
c does not lie face down in this gap, or point down and face left.
We have ruled those out.
c can't point down and face right because nothing fills the gap next to c.
Let c stand up, leaving a gap of 2y-h between c and b.
Its neighbor e cannot stand up, since 2h > 2y.
(I'm reserving d for the piece above a.)
A face or a tab fills the gap.
Suppose we put in the face of e, with e pointing left, which means c faces right.
e wraps around the face of c.
z = w-y, and z >= y.
w-y >= y.
The face of e consumes the tab of b and maybe more.
c, of width h consumes more than the tab of a.
They can't both fit.
So let e point right.
h + w-y = 2y.

Assume c faces right.
Across the a b gap, h > w-y.
Going up along the border of c and e, h > w-y.
There is a gap above c of width z.
Put f in the notch of c. This is a face or a tab.
Let f lie face down and point right.
Thus w-y = z.
If there is no gap between e and the tab of f then we have our third equation,
h = w-y + z, or h = 2z. That is order 2.
So there is a gap, and a face won't fit in, since w-y is already z.
It has to be the tab of a piece lying atop e.
2z = h + h-z.
ff+ff+f0f0f0f0, which fails.
Let f lie face down and point left.
If f fills the gap, as it did before, then z = w-y.
y + z >= h, and y >= h-z.
The tab of f pokes past the back of c.
The gap above a has width w-y,
which is smaller than y, and smaller than h.
It is z squares up to the tab of f.
With f poking in, nothing can fill this gap.
thus f does not fill the notch of c, and g slides in between f and e.
If the tab of g, then g faces right, and there are no other pieces in between.
w-y + h-z = z.
Combine this with the first equation and find y = z.
Fine, but y > h-z, and the tab of f still extends beyond c, and we still have the same problem above a.
Put the face of g between f and e,
and 2(w-y) = z.
If there is a gap between e and the tab of g, you might try to put a face in,
but then w-y + z = h + w-y.
If there is a gap between e and the tab of g, you might try to put a tab in,
but then z/2 + z = h + h-z, or 5z = 4h.
This is a new one, an 11 by 10 rectangle minus a 7 by 8 rectangle.
You can analyze it by trec, or note that the tab of f goes well beyond c
and hangs over a.
So there is no gap between e and g, and z/2 + z = h.
h-z = h/3, and the tab of f extends beyond c.
Therefore f puts its tab into the notch of c, rather than its face.
One tab won't work as z would be half of h.
Two tabs makes z 2/3 of h.
The face of f extends beyond c, and the gap above a cannot be filled.
c cannot stand facing right.

Let c stand up and face left.
Let d be the vertical reflection of a.
d wraps around the face of c, 2z = w-y, and z >= y.
w-Y >= 2y.
The face of e fills the whole gap, without room for c at all.

Let d point down onto a.
If the face of c rises above a then d must wrap around c.
y + z = w-y, but w-y < y.
If the face of c remains below the height of a, there is no way to fill the notch of d.
If the face of c is level with a then z = w-y.
The tab of d has to go all the way across, so that h-z = w-y + z.
This is our friend e0e080 again.

Let d stand up atop a.
With h > y > w-y, d goes beyond the face of a.
The face of c must be level with the height of a.
z = w-y.
If there is no gap between d and the tab of c then h = 2z, which is order 2.
No room for a face, so a tab, and just one tab of a piece facing right.
h + h-z = 2z.
trec @ff+ff+f0f0f0f0 fails.

A strange possibility is d lying down across a and c.
Again c is flush with the height of a, and z = w-y.
If d fits exactly then w = 2z.
This sets y = z = h.
If there is a gap then w < 2z, and y < z, and h < z.
That is the end of d, and c facing left, and e face down in b.

e points down into the notch of b and faces right.
h + h-z = 2y, and y >= z.
If there is no gap between b and the face of e then y = z = 2h/3.
If c faces left its face is not flush with the height of a, else w-y = z
and the shape has order 2.
Let d point down onto a.
h-z is no larger than w-y.
c must face right, the tab of d fills the gap above a,
h=z = w-y, h = w, and we have the pentomino e08080, which fails.
Let d be the reflection of a.
If c faces left then d wraps around the face of c, 2z = w-z, giving fcf0f0.
If c faces right then there is a gap between c and e, and the tab of d hangs above this gap so it can't be filled.
Since c and a are not flush, d cannot lie across a and c.
d stands atop a and faces right.
Since a and c are not flush, d cannot extend beyond the face of a.
w-y >= h.
That puts the face of c well above the height of a.
The gap above a is w-y across.
If h   = w-y we have f8e0e0, order 270.
Put f above a in the gap between d and c.
If f has its back to d then the z by z gap in the notch of d can't be filled.
f is face to face with d.
There is only one way to fill this double notch.
g points up and faces left; h points down and faces right; so that h + h-z = 2z.
At the left wall, w-z = 2z, but w-z is at least 2h.
That's it for f, and for d.
Therefore there is a gap between the face of b and the face of e.

No tabs in this gap, since h-z + z is h, which is larger than y.
Put the face of f in this gap, with f pointing down.
Across b, z = w-y.
If f fills the gap then y = 2z, giving fcfcfcf0f0, which fails.
If a second face fits in the gap we have y = 3z.
This yields ffffffffffc0c0, which fails.
Therefore the face of f fills the gap, with f pointing up.
y = z + w-y.
If the face of c is flush with the height of a, then w-y = z,
and we have the same three equations we saw before,
and the same piece fcfcfcf0f0.
The face of c is above or below a, and d, atop a, does not stand up or face up.
Let d lie face down, and let the face of c fill the double notch.
2z = w-y.
This is new, a 10 by 7 rectangle minus a 6 by 2 rectangle,
but the tabs of d and c collide.
If c faces right, the tab of d extends past the tab of c, since y > z-h.
The gap between c and e can't be filled.
Therefore d points down onto a.
If c faces right then w-y = z-h.
This implies y = h.
If c faces left, remember that c and a are not flush.
If c is below a we have gaps that can't be filled.
If c rises above a then w-y = z-h, and we have the same problem.
That's all for d, and filling the gap between b and e,
and e in the notch of b, and c standing up.

We're not quite done; c could lie face up in the double notch of a and b.
It won't be an exact fit, since y is not half of w.
If you add h, you have at least 2h, but the gap is 2y.
Put the face of d next to c in this gap.
If c points left then d points right.
If c points right then d can't point left or the piece has order 2.
Either way d points right, and its tab runs along the face of b.
With c and d we have our first equation: 2y = w + w-y. y = 2w/3.
Since y > w-y, the tab of d extends beyond the end of b.
In fact it extends y/2 or w/3 past b.

Put e on the floor next to b.
e can't point left, unless z is half of h.
e can't put its face under d, since w-y = h, and y/2 = h, making y > h.
e points right along the floor.
The tab of d is flush with the face of e.

Put f on the floor next to e.
Let f face or point right so that the gap in the notch of e has width y.
This is filled with faces or tabs.
Put g in the notch of e.
It can't point left because the tab of d is in the way, and it can't point right without creating a hole.
Suppose the tab of g fills the gap, so that h-z = y.
If g faces left, y >= z + h-z, which is impossible.
g faces right, and the face of g is 2y off the floor.
With w = 3y, f must point right.
With no gap between f and g, h = 2y. This sets 2z = h.
So there is a gap, and a tab won't fit.
Suppose the face of h fits in, with h pointing down.
Across the face of f we find w-y = z.
But y > w-y, so going down the face of f, the tab of h crashes into the tab of f.
Thus h points up, just one face in the gap, and 2y = h + w-y.
3y = w+h, and w = h.
This is our old friend e0e080.
So we need two tabs, g and h pointing down and back to back.
That has g facing left which we already ruled out.
That's the end of f facing or pointing right.

Let f face left.
If the face of f rises above e we have the same gap of y, with the same problems.
The case that is somewhat different is g pointing down and facing right,
and filling the gap of e,
but then w-y must be more than y, when it is only half of y.
The face of f below the tab of e doesn't work at all.
Let e and f be flush, giving a gap of width y+z, which is less than 2h.
h-z = w-y = y/2.
Put g in the notch of e.
As before, g can't lie face down, and can't point down and face left.
Let g point down facing right, whence h fits in the gap of g.
This could only be a tab, with y = h-z, thus y = w-y, which doesn't work.
Let g stand.
The gap is y+z, or 2(y/2) + z, or 2(h-z) + z, or h + h-z.
The tab or face of h, either having width h-z, fills the gap between g and f.
h can't face left with g standing there.
h can't point left because g would face right, and z = w-y = h-z.
Let h point right.
With no gaps we have z = y.
This is e08080.
With at least one tab in between we have z >= y + h-z.
This is z >= w which doesn't work.
Therefore h points down and faces right.
If g faces right there is a z by y gap to fill.
If g faces left there is a z by z gap to fill.
If one tab fills the gap we have h-z = z.
Two tabs sets 2(h-z) = z, or z is 2/3 of h.
This is again e08080.
That's the end of g standing up in the notch of e.

Let g lie face up across e and f.
If g fits exactly then w = y+z.
This makes z half of y.
h-y/2 = y/2, and h = y.
If there's more room we need one or more tabs or faces,
but we already saw, when g stood up, there was just room for g and one more piece.
w is at least h, so g is square with h = w.
3y/2 - z = y/2.
y = z, and we're back to e08080.
That's the end of g, and f facing left.

Finally f points left, so that e and f look like a and b.
g, in the notch of e,doesn't face down or point down facing left.
If g points down and faces right then h points left and puts its tab in the notch of g.
h-z = y.
Across e and f, h-z + w = w + w-y, hence h-z = w-y.
w-y = y, which is a contradiction.
Let g stand in the notch of e.
g goes beyond e, but doesn't fill the entire gap.
If the tab of h completes it then h + h-z = 2y.
If g faces right there is a z by y gap to fill.
If g faces left there is a z by h-y/2 gap to fill.
One tab never works in this context.
Two tabs sets z = 2/3 of h.
y = z, and we have e08080 again.
One face sets w-y = z, or z = half of y.
z isn't long enough to fill the gap between g and h, so g faces left, and i, in the notch of g, points left.
travel up the face of g, and i, and find w-y + z, or y/2 + y/2, or y.
This is less than h, so i crashes into d.

With g still standing, h lies face down next to g.
If h points left then z = w-y = y/2.
Across g, z < y, so the tab of h crashes into the tab of g.
thus h points right.
h + w-y = 2y.
h is 3/2 of y, as is w.
Whether g faces left or right, there is a z by h-y/2 gap to fill.
One tab won't do, and two tabs creates e08080 again.
If one face fits in then z = w-y = y/2.
This is e0e080.
If two faces fit in then z = y/2 + y/2, and e08080 again.
If we have a face and a tab, z = h-z + w-y = h-z + y/2.
z = y, and it's e08080 again.
That's it for g standing up.

g lies down across e and f, so that e f and g look somewhat like a b and c.
Let h lie face down next to g.
h can't point left or it's order 2.
h points right, and extends beyond f.
In fact this looks just like b and d.
The pattern repeats, but it can't repeat forever,
so assume h points down into the corner of f and g.
This is an orientation we haven't yet considered for d.
It's coming, but when we consider that we won't have our first equation relating w and y.
Let h face left, which means g points right.
h-z = y.
Between the faces of g and h is a y-z gap to fill.
h-z is bigger than y-z, so even one tab is too much.
Two faces is y, also too much.
One face means y/2 = y-z.
This is e0e080.
h faces right, and completes the e-f double notch, so that h-z is half of y.
If there is no gap between the faces of f and h, then y = z.
This is e08080.
The gap is y-z, and since h-z is larger, even a tab won't fit.
A face of w-y sets z to half of y.
h-z is also half of y, h-z = z, order 2.
two faces would equal y, which is too much.
And that is all the posibilities for h, g, f, and e.

As promised, we must consider d pointing down into the corner of b and c.
Let d face left, whence c points right against the tab of d.
h-z = y.
The a-b double notch is 2y across, and c takes up more than half of it, w being greater than y.
The tab of d is h-z, which is y, and there isn't room for this tab.

Let d face right.
Its tab must complete the double notch, thus w + h-z = 2y.
If there is no gap between the faces of b and d then y = z.
w + h = 3y.
With z > h/2,the tab of c stays below the height of a.
There is a gap of width y to fill.
A tab is not enough.
A face can't fill the gap exactly, so it is not enough or too much.
Two faces makes 2w = 3y. Yet w + h = 3y, so w = h.
This is e08080.
Two tabs creats the same shape.
A tab and a face sets w + h = 3y, which is already implied by equations 1 and 2.
If c points left, and e and f fill the notch of c, there is a gap between a and e that can't be filled.
If c points right, h-z + z >= w.
This sets h = w, and we're back to e08080.
Therefore there is a gap between b and d.

This gap is y-z, too small for a tab.
If filled by a face then w-y = y-z, w + z = 2y.
Combine this with equation 1, and h = 2z.
Put in e pointing down and f pointing up.
To cover the face of b, 2z = w-y.
Going up the tab of d, 3z = y.
This creates the impossible situation of h < y.
That's all for d, and c, and b, and a.

Combine {7} through {12}, and we are done with y < h.
Henceforth, y >= h.

	13. y = h and h+z = w.

This shape has order 4.
a points down into the corner,
and b fills the notch of a and points right, into another corner, etc.
The result is a square, w + h-z on a side.

This is a class of shapes.
If h = 1, z can be any real number strictly between 0 and 1.
The square has area 4.
If z is irrational the result isn't even a polyomino, but still has order 4.
For z rational, scale the picture so that z and h are relatively prime integers.
Example: h = 5 and z = 3.
This is ffffe0e0e0.

	14. y=h.

One of the three equations is established at the outset, but there are
more possibilities, such as a piece pointing down onto the floor.
{4} is not in force.

Suppose a points down onto the floor, and b points into a.
Since h is not h-z, there is a gap.
Thanks to {13}, the face of c cannot fill the gap between a and b.
If we want a to point down, b points right, filling the notch of a.

Thanks to {13}, a and b are not flush.
Suppose a extends beyond the face of b, hence z > w-y.
Only the face of c can fill the notch of b,
but this would again set w-y = z.
So the face of b is farther right, giving w-y > z.

I'll continue this theorem as time permits, or you can continue my work.
Please review this theorem and send along any corrections.
If you wish, clean it up, improve the explanations, and add pictures for clarity.
