	Specific Shape, c080!00c0!40

Start with the pentomino c080!00c0, which has order 108,
but put a knob on one of its legs.
The knob is distal to the cube that connects the two legs.
This is in contrast to c080!00c040.

Put A in the lower left back corner.
Without loss of generality, assume A in the corner runs left to right.
If the knob of A is in the corner, A presents a hole against the floor and the back wall.
This is filled by the knob of B, which presents another hole,
whence the pieces travel along the edge forever.

Let the knob of A point right.
The blunt end of A establishes a hole with the left wall.
This hole cannot be trapped against the corner of the box.
Roll A 90 degrees, and the hole is on the floor.
B puts its knob into this hole, and C puts its knob into the hole of B,
and pieces travel along the floor toward us forever.
Roll A the other way and the hole is against the back wall.
Pieces climb up the back wall forever.
Therefore A lies on its back, with the hole away from the floor and the back wall.
There is a gap of height 2 between A and the back wall,
and the knob of A protrudes to the right.
Put B immediately to the right of A on the floor.
There is only one way to do this.
The knob of B slides in behind A,
then B wraps around the knob of A.
Fine, but B presents a hole with the back wall.
The knob of C fills this hole, and pieces travel along the back wall forever.

That completes the proof.
