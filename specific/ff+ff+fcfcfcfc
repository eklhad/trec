	Specific Shape, ff+ff+fcfcfcfc

Consider a 6 by 6 square with a 2 by 3 flagpole sticking up from the top, on one side.
This shape is "standing up" or "pointing up"
when it is oriented vertically, with its pole pointing up.

Verify that this shape cannot point down or lie face down on the floor.

Moving to the lower left corner, we may assume that a stands up and faces right.
If b, to the right of a, is vertical, and faces right, it creates a gap
of width 4, filled by two pieces pointing down,
and one of those pieces crashes into the y axis.
Thus b faces a, creating a gap of width 8.
Fill this gap with c and d standing back to back, one up and one down.
Now d points down and faces right, and extends two squares beyond the right edge of b.
Place e on the floor next to b and note that e must stand up and face right, just like a.
If f, next to e, faces e, we are merely repeating the pattern established by a and b.
This could continue forever, so assume f is horizontal.
In fact it must point right, and g, on the floor next to f, must point left.
This creates a gap of width 6 that is filled by h.
If h points left we have a gap of width 7 atop e and f that cannot be filled.
So h stands up or points right, and we have a gap of width 10 atop e and f.
This is also unfillable, hence we have reached a contradiction.

The same contradiction appears if b lies down and points right.
